# Technical Notes

- **Stack**: Vite + React + TypeScript + React Router (hash-based for static hosting). State lives in `QuizContext`, backed by `public/quizzes.json` fetches and localStorage attempts.
- **Data flow**: `QuizProvider` loads quizzes once on boot and seeds attempts from `localStorage`. Consumers use the `useQuizData` hook to keep UI and exports in sync.
- **Quiz UX**: Questions appear sequentially (matching `layout_quiz_question.png`). Each submission reveals correctness and an explanation before navigation.
- **Exports**: Buttons on the main page produce `quizzes-export.json` and `quiz-results-export.json` via `Blob` downloads so users can archive or migrate data offline.
- **Testing**: Vitest + Testing Library cover routing, storage, page rendering, data exports, layout responsiveness (via a `matchMedia` mock), and quiz flows.
- **Styling**: Global CSS uses cards/grids inspired by the provided mockups. The `useResponsiveLayout` hook toggles stacked layouts below 720px.
- **Static updates**: Replace `public/quizzes.json` on any CDN or object storage bucket to refresh questions without a rebuild (documented inline and in README).
